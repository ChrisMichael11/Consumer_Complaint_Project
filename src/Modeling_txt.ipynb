A year later, Seterus claims I owe that money and they had never received the funds.Of course they increased my ESCROW so I had to do their job, contact XXXX, have them re-issue the check, send it to Seterus via Register Return Receipt, once I confirmed the check was received by Seterus, I called to follow up, and they still claimed the check had not been receive, I lost it and told them off.They increased my mortgage payment and said once they received the check, they will do another escrow analysis and it would take up to 30 business days to make any adjustments in my account. XXXX & behold they made the adjustments and 30 days exactly my mortgage payment was re-adjusted, ( which leads me to believe they had the check all along and did not want to admit it ).

If these XXXX ups are the lack of service Seterus creates, then why nothing is being done, why does n\\'t Seterus pay out of their pockets these kind of financial XXXX ups caused by their lack of service?

Throughout all this we managed to make the payments on this loan.. Then in XX/XX/XXXX we just did n't have the money ... We called and made a partial payment, we tried to make a partial payment the following month and they would not accept it ... So I stopped paying as they told me they were turning me over for legal action ...

About a week or so ago, my ex called me to tell me she had gotten a letter from them stating I now have a court date for XX/XX/XXXX I believe ... I then contacted them as while they have been sending all these collection notices they have also been sending more of those checks hoping I would cash another.. Which I have not.. Cant afford the loan I do have ... Anyway I contacted them and then went to see them this morning.. I took them a payment and told them I needed to know when I took out the loan, how much I borrowed and how much I have paid back.. I also wanted to know my balance ... The original note was for XXXX on XXXX XXXX, XXXX Then in XX/XX/XXXX I borrowed another XXXX ... They combined the loans and I had been paying XXXX a month until I reached a point I no longer could pay that amount ... Today I was told my total loan amount was for XXXX I have paid in XXXX.

What are my options here? My gf and I are no longer together, I am playing catch up on all my bills as I had to pay hers as well because she was unable to work ... I can not afford to pay these people 150 some dollars a month and I need some help ... I am of the opinion this company as well as others like it go through and get peoples credit scores and then in knowing they can not afford a loan, would not be approved for a normal loan, they then send out these checks to the poor who need help.. Then when the poor cash the checks they are in a vicious debt trap ... And they harass you sometimes calling XXXX-XXXX times a week wanting to know when they can expect their payments ...
